# Quantum-Maze
A Quantum Maze game that can be solved only with successful quantum key distribution.
Two users A and B are stuck in a maze and the only way they can leave the maze is by inputting the same bit of strings i.e. a secret key. However if anyone else learns their key that person will use the key to lock them in.
